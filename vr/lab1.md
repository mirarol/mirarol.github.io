## Lab 1 - Viewer
**Level of Difficulty: Easy**

## About
In this lab we will be using the [Cardboard VR Photo Sphere Viewer](https://sphcst.com/upload). The Photo Sphere View is a single scene 360 image viewer. It will not work with 360 video *(I tried it unsuccessfully!)*. For this project there will be no storyboarding, however, you will need one 360 image. 

You will not be able to add any interactive elements to your VR experience, this is just a view. Of the three VR experiences, this is the easiest and fastest to create. 

## Assets
You will need one 360 image asset. You can either donwload the imag or copy the URL of a single 360 image assset from one of the following locations:
1. [Myra's 360 Asset Folders](https://github.com/myramade/myramade.github.io/tree/master/vr/assets)
2. [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?q=equirectangular&tbm=isch&tbs=isz:l&cad=h)
3. [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/groups/equirectangular/)
4. [Photopin](http://photopin.com/free-photos/equirectangular)

Once you have your asset downloaded or an asset link, you are ready to begin.

2. Do one of the following: Upload your 360 image or enter the URL of your 360 image. 
*Note: If you are using one of my assets found here in my Github repo, you'll need to click click on the image name to open it and then select **Copy Path**. This will copy the URL for the image, you can simply paste it onto the Google Cardboard site.*

3. The Google Cardboard site will create a custom link for your project. 

## Test
:rocket: You should always test your builds before you publish it to the world. Now grab your smartphone and open the web browser on your phone and type your project URL in the web browser. Drop your phone in a VR headset and being testing. 
There isn't much to test here, you want to make sure you image is displaying correctly. 

## Publish
Now you can share the URL with your colleagues, friends and family.
