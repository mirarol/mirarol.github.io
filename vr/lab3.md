# Lab 3 - Navtive VR 
Level of Difficulty: Normal

## About
In this lab, we will design a navtive VR experiencing using 360 images and video with gaze-activated content. Native VR is equipment dependent, in the case of this prototype, it will be a mobile app that will be built using a web interface and publish as to an app. We will be using [Warp Studio's VR Creator](https://warp.studio/). 

## Design 
Our design will have multiple scenes, use your [VR_FOV_Template](VR_FOV_Template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ekhp9eue6gendp2/VR_FOV_Template.pdf?dl=0)) to storyboard the VR experience you will create:
* Homeworld 
* Scene 2
* Scene 3
* Scene 4

## Assets
For this lab you will need to three to five VR Assets, we will use a combination of 360 images and video. Either download or grab the URL for each assets :
