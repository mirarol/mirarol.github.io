## Lab 2 - WebVR
 **Level of Difficulty: Normal**

## About
In this lab, we will design a WebVR experience using 360 images and video with gaze-activated content. Our design will have 3 scenes, use your [VR_FOV_Template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ekhp9eue6gendp2/VR_FOV_Template.pdf?dl=0) to storyboard the VR experience you will create:
* Homeworld - The homeworld have menu that will allow the user to enter a different scene. 
* Scene 2 - The 2nd scene will offer text-based information to the user and have a menu that takes the user back to the homeworld
* Scene 3 - The 3rd scene will 

## Assets
For this lab you will need to three (3) VR Assets, we will use a combination of 360 images and video. Either download or grab the URL for each assets :
1. [Myra's 360 Asset Folders](https://github.com/myramade/myramade.github.io/tree/master/vr/assets)
2. [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?q=equirectangular&tbm=isch&tbs=isz:l&cad=h)
3. [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/groups/equirectangular/)
4. [Photopin](http://photopin.com/free-photos/equirectangular)

You will need to either download the 360 images/videos or get their URLs (write the image/video name in your VR storyboard) Now you're read move onto the *Build* phase

## Build
1. Go to https://seakbeak.com and create an *free* account

2. **Add your assets**. You'll be taken to your snaps dashboard, let's begin by uploading the three 360 images/videos you downloaded. Click the **+** at the top right of the screen. The *New Snap* screen displays, do one of the following: drag and drop an image or video to the *New Snap* window or paste the image or video URL into the *Get Image!* field. Repeat this step for all three of your assets.

3. **Create a Group**. Now that you've uploaded your assets, let's create a group for our assets.  Click on *Groups*. On the *Groups* page, select *Add Group* and enter a name for your Group and a *Public Display Name* (this can be the same as the group name), then click the *Add Group* button.

4. **Add assets to the new group**. Select *Snaps* at the top of the page to go back to your *Snap Dashboard*. A folder now appears next to the *Managing Snaps in Group* field. Click the folder icon, you'll notice that drop-down menus appear under each of your assets. Add you assets to the new group you created by selecting it in the drop-down menu of each asset. 

Your assets are now groups. You can find them by selecting the group name in the *Managing Snaps in Group* drop-down.

5. **Edit Scenes** Now, that we are organized, let's build. Double-click on your *homeworld* image form the *Snaps* page. Your image will open full screen. You'll see an arrow at the bottom of your image, click it to open the *navigation bar*, then select *Edit*. The navigation bar will change to display a set of tools.

6. Here we are going to begin by setting the start position of our *homeworld*. Drag the image around to the position you would like it to open when a user enters the scene. Then, select  *Prefs* in the navigation bar. Scroll down to the *Prefs* screen to *Set current position as Snap start position* and select **_Set Start Position_**. Once the screen saves, click the **X** let's of the *Prefs* screen.

7. Now, let's add a hotspot. We are going to create two hotspots - one for Scene 2 and another for Scene 3. We will also add Welcome text.Select *Add* from the navigation bar. a Large crosshair will appear, click your mouse where you want to add the hotspot. If it's not in the position you want it, you can move it by clicking and dragging. Double-click the hotspot to edit it. 

8. The *hotspot edit* menu gives us a few options. Let's start by changing the *Type* by clicking the type icon and selecting *Snap* as the new type. We will skip changing the *Icon* since the hotspot will jump to another *Snap*  Now, select the scene you want the hotspot to jump to. Make sure your *group* is selected in the first drop-down, then select the *Snap* you want to jump to. When you're happy with the settings, click *Accept*. You'll notice a thumbnail of the scene appears in your hotspot.

8. Drag your scene around to the location where you will place your second hotspot and repeat the *Steps 7 & 8*. Once you have added both hotspots, click *Save*]

9. Click on *Thumbs* in the navigation bar and double-click the next scene you will edit. The new scene will appear full-screen. Follow *Steps 5 - 8* to add two hotspot to your scene, one that takes the user back to the *homeworld* and another that gives your user information about the scene. Remember to click *Accept* after you create each hotspot then click *Save to save the changes to the scene.

**You're at the home stretch**

## Test
:rocket: Using your smartphone, open a web browser and open your SeekBeak link. Drop your phone in a VR headset and test. Things you are lookig for are: 
* Flow - does you story flow? Does the information you display make sense? What other items would you add or edit?
* Functionality - is it working the way you intented? Are all the hotspots opening correctly?
* Grammatical - Are there any misspelling? Bad grammar? Are the terms you using clear and concise?
* Usability - are you images and video easy to navigate? Are the locations of your hotspots easy to find? Will the user intutively know that you hotspot is a hotspot? 

Make edits and tweaks based on your findings before moving on. 

## Publish 

It's time to publish your VR experience. This is the simple step, after you've edited all your scenes and have tested by making sure your hotspots link the way you intended them, you are ready to publish your work. By publish, I mean *Share*. 

Select *Share* from the navigation bar and select how you want to share. I suggest just using the link for now, so click the *link* icon. There you will see a public URL that you can share with you users. That's literally all it take to publish.
