# Lab 4 - Native VR [EEVO]
Level of Difficulty: Normal

## About
In this lab, we will design a navtive VR experiencing using 360 images and video with gaze-activated content. Native VR is equipment dependent, in the case of this prototype, it will be a mobile app that will be built using a web interface and publish as to an app. We will be using [EEVO](https://console.eevo.com/login). 

## Design 
In EEVO you will create a *Scenario* and within your *Scenario* you will create a number of *Scenes*. Our design will have four (4) scenes, use your [VR_FOV_Template](VR_FOV_Template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ekhp9eue6gendp2/VR_FOV_Template.pdf?dl=0)) to storyboard the VR experience you will create:
* Homeworld 
* Scene 2
* Scene 3
* Scene 4
